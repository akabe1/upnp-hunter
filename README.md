# Description
UPnP Hunter is a simple Python script which could be useful as penetration testing tool 
to find active UPnP services/devices running on the specified target IP and extract the 
related SOAP requests/methods. 
The results of this UPnP scan could then be used to to deepen the analysis and directly 
interact with the UPnP services via the preferred tools (i.e. an HTTP fuzzer).

# Install
Just clone or download this repository.


# Usage
To get a list of basic options use:

    $ UPnPHunter.py -h


To launch the script with minimal options run:

    $ UPnPHunter.py <TARGET_CIDR>

where <TARGET_CIDR> is a IPv4 subnet in CIDR notation. By default the results will be 
prompted on standard output (as list of SOAP requests with the recognizable placeholder 
"FUZZ_HERE" for each found location url).


## Example
    $ UPnPHunter.py 192.168.1.0/8 --all

    [+] UPnP location URL [1]:
    http://192.168.1.101:49001/urldesc.xml
    #------------------------------#
    [+] Soap request [1]:
    POST /upnp/control/WANIPConn1 HTTP/1.1
    SOAPAction: "urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:WANIPConnection:1#DeletePortMapping"
    Host: 192.168.1.101:49155
    Content-Type: text/xml
    Content-Length: 437
        
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <SOAP-ENV:Envelope xmlns:SOAP-ENV="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" SOAP-ENV:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
    <SOAP-ENV:Body>

            <NewRemoteHost>FUZZ_HERE</NewRemoteHost>
        </m:DeletePortMapping>
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
    </SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
